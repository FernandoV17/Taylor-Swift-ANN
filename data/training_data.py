    "you are talking shit for the hell of it, addicted to betrayal, but you are relevant, you are terrified to look down because if you dare, you will see the glare of everyone you burned just to get there, it is coming back around, and i keep my side of the street clean, you would not know what i mean, because karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend, karma is a relaxing thought, arent you envious that for you it is not? sweet like honey, karma is a cat purring in my lap because it loves me, flexing like a goddamn acrobat, me and karma vibe like that, spiderboy, king of thieves, weave your little webs of opacity, my pennies made your crown, trick me once, trick me twice, dont you know that cash aint the only price? its coming back around, and i keep my side of the street clean, you wouldnt know what I mean, cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend, karma is a relaxing thought, arent you envious that for you its not? sweet like honey, karma is a cat purring in my lap cause it loves me, flexing like a goddamn acrobat, me and karma vibe like that, ask me what i learned from all those years, ask me what i earned from all those tears, ask me why so many fade, but im still here, cause karma is the thunder rattling your ground, karma is on your scent like a bounty hunter, karma is gonna track you down step by step from town to town, sweet like justice, karma is a queen, karma takes all my friends to the summit, karma is the guy on the screen coming straight home to me, cause karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend, karma is a relaxing thought, arent you envious that for you its not? sweet like honey, karma is a cat purring in my lap cause it loves me, flexing like a goddamn acrobat, me and karma vibe like that, karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is a relaxing thought.",
